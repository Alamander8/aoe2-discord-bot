# AoE2 AutoSpectator Project Notes
December 27, 2024

## Overview
Today we significantly improved the AutoSpectator's ability to understand and react to game state by implementing a sophisticated territory tracking and combat detection system. The main improvements focused on three key areas: territory understanding, raid detection, and intelligent camera management.

## Key Components

### Territory Tracker
- Implemented a heat map-based system for tracking player territories
- Uses HSV color detection to identify player-controlled areas
- Distinguishes between main bases and forward positions
- Continuously updates territory understanding as the game progresses

### Forward Position Detection
- Enhanced distance-based detection using strategic thresholds
- Calculates strategic value based on distance from main base and size
- Prevents false positives from walls and nearby structures
- Uses morphological operations to clean up noise in detection

### Raid Detection System
- Identifies enemy units in friendly territory
- Uses importance scoring (0.0-1.0) to prioritize significant raids
- Considers unit density and strategic positioning
- Implements probabilistic viewing for lower-importance raids to maintain variety

### Camera Management
- Prioritizes high-importance combat (>0.8 importance)
- Uses randomization for medium and low importance events
- Maintains viewing queue for regular activities
- Implements minimum view durations to prevent rapid switching

## Technical Details

### Territory Analysis
- Main bases identified by sustained high unit/building density
- Forward positions must be >100 pixels from main base
- Uses strategic value calculation: (distance / min_distance) * (area / 100)
- Heat maps updated every 2 seconds

### Combat Detection
- High importance (>0.8): Always viewed
- Medium importance (0.6-0.8): 70% chance to view
- Low importance (<0.6): 30% chance to view
- Uses moment calculations for precise position detection

### Viewing Pattern Improvements
- Random selection from top 3 forward positions
- Importance threshold randomization (0.3-0.7) for normal activities
- Random selection from top 5 valid zones
- Minimum 3-second view duration, maximum 6-second

## Results
The system successfully:
- Identifies and tracks player territories
- Detects and prioritizes combat events
- Maintains engaging viewing patterns
- Balances between combat focus and base monitoring

## Future Improvements
Consider:
1. Territory change tracking over time
2. Combat prediction based on unit movements
3. Economic activity detection
4. Multi-player support beyond 1v1
5. Game stage awareness for priority adjustment

## Key Lessons
1. Balance between focused combat viewing and variety is crucial
2. Distance thresholds are critical for forward position detection
3. Probabilistic viewing decisions prevent stale camera work
4. Heat maps provide reliable territory understanding

## Usage Notes
- Debug visualizations available with --debug-visual flag
- Territory updates occur every 2 seconds
- System works best with clear color differentiation
- Forward position detection may need tuning for different map sizes
